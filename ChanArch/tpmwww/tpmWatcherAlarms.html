<center><h1>SDSS Telescope Performance Monitor Watcher Alarms</h1>
Version: 15 August 2003</center>
<blockquote>
The SDSS TPM sends a subset of its native alarms to the Watcher.
Within IOP a tpmHandler process is periodically run that uses the
EPICS Channel Access client interface (via the UNIX executable
caGet1) to obtain the alarm severities of a number of TPM records.
These records are then grouped by category, for example M1_TEMP
for all primary mirror thermal management problems. 
<p>
The alarm severities are, in order of increasing criticality,
NO_ALARM, MINOR, MAJOR, and INVALID. The INVALID state
is set when communications with a device are lost, i.e. when
we have no information about a system.
<p>
The IOP tpmHandler finds the maximum severity within each group,
and populates the tpmError array with that severity and the tpmData
array with the corresponding catagory. These two arrays are
then transmitted to the Watcher.
<p>
The following tables list the individual TPM channels that IOP and
the Watcher monitor, the Watcher alarm category they contribute
to, and a short description. More detailed channel descriptions
can be found using the <a href="ChannelGuide.html#getinfo">
TPM channel query interfaces</a>.

<p>
<h3>Alarm Group: M1_TEMP</h3>
The M1_TEMP alarm group checks for thermal gradients within the 
primary mirror of the SDSS 2.5 meter and excessive differences
between the mirror and its environment. The quoted limits are in degC
and are those originally specified by Jim Gunn. The TPM is presently
running with these limits uniformly increased by a factor of 3.

<h3>Alarm Group: M2_TEMP</h3>
The M2_TEMP alarm group checks for thermal gradients within the 
secondary mirror of the SDSS 2.5 meter and excessive differences
between the mirror and its environment. The quoted limits are in degC
and are those originally specified by Jim Gunn. The TPM is presently
running with these limits uniformly increased by a factor of 3.

<h3>Alarm Group: ENV_TEMP</h3>
The ENV_TEMP alarm group checks for  
excessive differences between the telescope structure, the rotating floor,
the lower enclosure, the return air from cooling system,
and the environments.
The quoted limits are in degC
and are those originally specified by Jim Gunn. The TPM is presently
running with these limits uniformly increased by a factor of 3.

<tr><td>tpm_TM_Lowair_Telair</td>
<td>Excessive difference betweer lower enclosure and ambient</td><td>-3.0, 3.0</td></tr></table>

<h3>Alarm Group: TRACKING</h3>
The TRACKING alarm group checks the magnitudes of the axis servo errors
when the telescope is assumed to be tracking. The alarm limits are in encoder
counts and define the MINOR (warning level) and MAJOR (problems) conditions.
<p>
<table border width="90%">
<tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><td width=30%> <b>TPM CHANNEL</b></td>
<td><b>DESCRIPTION</b></td>
<td><b>LIMITS</b></td></tr>

<h3>Alarm Group: CURRENTS</h3>
The CURRENTS alarm group checks the reported motor currents for possible
problems. The present limits (in counts) are arbitrary. These alarms
have never been enabled.

weight limits in pounds.

<h3>Alarm Group: TMICRO</h3>
The TMICRO alarm group monitors the state of the serial communication
between the TPM and the Temperature Micro in addition to checking
for broken or faulty sensors. A sensor fault condition is assumed
if the readback is less than -50 degC.
