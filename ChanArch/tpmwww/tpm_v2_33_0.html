<h3>Alarms</h3>

<b>PR 4973/4494:</b>
TPM Alarms
<p>

<b>Item:</b>
Corrected INP fields for tpm_TM_M1EdgeAvg temperature sensor 
calculation. These had ".INPA" field extension missing and as
a consequence were using a value of 0 obtained from the 
default ".VAL" field.
<p>
Working file: rtApp/Db/temp_alarms.db
<p>
<b>Item:</b>
Changed LOW (MINOR alarm) thresholds for tpm_Ndewar_spectro 
and tpm_Sdewar_imager from 75 lb to 100 lb per Jim Gunn and Jon
Brinkmann.
<p>
<b>To test:</b>
Verify lack of TPM alarms associated with M1 temperatures. Also
check value using<br>
$ caget tpm_TN_M1EdgeAvg
<p>
Working file: rtApp/Db/scale.db
<p>
<b>Item:</b>
Reenabled the following TPM/watcher alarms:
<li>tpm_TM_M1Upper_FB.SEVR 
<li>tpm_TM_M1Right_FB.SEVR
<li>tpm_TM_M1_FB.SEVR
<li>tpm_Serial.VALA (spectro dewar)
<li>tpm_Serial.VALB (imager dewar)
<li>tpm_TM_M0B0Chans.SEVR
<p>
The temperature alarms were reenabled due to the M1 sensors
being repaired and the operations requirement that fauly sensors
are replaced/patched immediately.
<p>
The dewar scale communications alarms were reenabled due to the
fixes made in tpm_v2_31_0.
<p>
<b>To test:</b>
Look at TPM/Watcher alarms.

<b>PR 4659:</b>

<p>
<b>Item:</b>
New version of database and displays from Jon Brinkmann.
<p>
<b>To test:</b>
Check TPM displays of the PLC analogs for valid readings.
