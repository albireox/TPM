<h3>Temperature Sensors</h3>
Fixed M2 Back Plate graphic - misidentification of top sensor.
<p>
<b>Shakedown: </b>
Verify sensor channel - should be Module 1, Block 0, Sensor 1
[VALA (raw) or VALJ (scaled)].
<p>
Added temperature inhomogeneity calculations and displays. These
implement what was specified in Jim Gunn's requirements document
(sdss-controls/333, 1 Nov 2000) with the exception of:
<ul>
<li>Item b: Alarm if any two sensors on a given mirror are different
by more than Mir_Del, where Mir_Del is about 2C.</li>
<li>Item c: Alarm if any linear gradient is greater than Mir_Grad,
where Mir_Grad is about 2C.
</ul>
Supporting documentation includes 
<a href="temp_alarms.html">
details on the temperature alarms</a>
and <a href="alarms.html">
general notes on alarms.</a>
<p>
<b>Shakedown: </b>
Examine and understand alarm displays. See below for new
display hierarchy.
<p>
Created temperature sensor WWW pages that are updated every 15 minutes.
These are accessible from the main TPM WWW page and require
RELOAD or Shift-RELOAD to update.
This task was added to the
<b>/p/tpmbase/ChanArch/bin/startTpmLog start</b>
cron job that executes at 0, 15, 30, and 45 minutes past the hour. This
is not much more than reformatting of output from the caGet1 UNIX
executable.
<p>
<b>Shakedown: </b>
Examine WWW pages.
<p>
Changed the default temperature sensor median filter length from
16 to 17.
<p>
<b>Shakedown: </b>
Note change on SENSOR DATA display - see below.
<p> 
Restructured the temperature sensor displays. The new hierarchy 
starting from the TEMPERATURES pull-down menu on the main display
is:
<ul>
<li>SENSOR DATA - tpm_micro.dl
<ul>
<li>Pull down menus for eight channel blocks on each of the three sensor 
modules (tpm_microblk.dl).
</ul>
<li>GRAPHICS - tpm_temp_graphics.dl
<ul>
<li>M1 - tpm_temp_m1.dl
<li>M2 - tpm_temp_m2.dl
<li>TRUSS - tpm_temp_truss.dl
</ul>
<li>ALARMS - tpm_temp_alarms.dl
<ul>
<li>ALARM CONFIG - tpm_temp_config.dl (informational only)
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Shakedown: </b>
Become familiar with new display tree.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>Archiver</h3>
Added Allen-Bradley interlock system data to the archiver.
The configuration file ab.cfg contains all 166 16-bit words
obtained from the Allen-Bradley system. The TPM channel guide
<a href="Channels.html">
document</a> was updated to include these channels.
<p>
<b>Shakedown: </b>
Verify presence of Allen-Bradley channels in archive files.
<p>

Installed a static-tcl build of CASI using SWIG 1.1p5 under
EPICS_EXTENSIONS. <b>PR: tpm/2095</b>.
 I've tested a few of the demo applications
that didn't require BLT - which I didn't include. This is
just a build of something we've already had - not a new
product.
The documentation is on the TPM WWW page - follow the
link to LANL.
<p>   
As an example:<br>
    % setup tpm<br>
    % cd $EPICS_EXTENSIONS/src/ChannelArchiver/casi/tcl <br>

<p>
<b>Shakedown: </b>
Study on-line documentation at LANL WWW pages and understand
the examples in $EPICS_EXTENSIONS/src/ChannelArchiver/casi/tcl.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>UPS</h3>
Modified the TPM ups table (tpm.table) to use envAppend() instead
of pathAppend(). <b>PRs: tpm/1750, tpm/2033.</b>
<p>
<b>Shakedown: </b>
Test TPM setup under different shells. Please note that I never
had a problem under bash.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>Serial Ports</h3>
Rearranged some of the serial port assignments on the 8 port
transition module. The specific changes were:
<ul>
<li>Moved the M1 MIG from the TPM console to Port 6.
<li>Moved the M2 MIG from Port 1 to Port 7.
<li>Moved the TMICRO from Port 6 to Port 1.
</ul>
<p>
The present port configuration is:
<table border width="75%">
<tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><th width="20%">Port #</th>
<th width="50%">Device</th>
<th width="30%">Setup</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>TMICRO</td><td>9600, 8N1</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>M1 Galil</td><td>38400, 8N1</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>M2 Galil</td><td>38400, 8N1</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Spectro dewar scale</td><td>2400, 8N1</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Imager dewar scale</td><td>2400, 8N1</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>M1 MIG</td><td>9600, 8N1</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>M2 MIG</td><td>9600, 8N1</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>*EMPTY*</td><td>9600, 8N1</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<b>Shakedown: </b>
Check M1 MIG, M2 MIG, and TMICRO displays for proper data.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>Galils</h3>
Modified the Galil interface parsing logic due to addition of a
new field (timestamp?) by Russell Owen. In theory the TPM has
to parse responses from both the M1 and M2 Galils which have different
channel counts. Previously it counted the number of fields
in the string (nf) and assigned:
<ul>
<li>0 - expected strlen
<li>1 .. nf-3 - values
<li>nf-2 - home flag
<li>nf-1 - commanded/current flag
</ul>
The new assignments are:
<ul>
<li>0 - expected strlen
<li>1 .. nf-4 - values
<li>nf-3 - home flag
<li>nf-2 - commanded/current flag
<li>nf-1 - timestamp (ignored) 
</ul>
<p>
<b>Shakedown: </b>
Check the M2 Galil display for proper data.
The M2 Galil interface is scanned once every .05 second.
The TPM interface to the M1 Galil is presently turned
off since no encoder information is available.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>PMSS</h3>
The PMSS MUX was tested and the following changes were made to the
TPM:
<ul>
<li>Input scale factor was decreased by a factor of 2
<li>For output the MUX control word had to be inverted to use active-low logic
<li>For output the order of the bits had to be reversed to work with the as-built wiring
</ul>
<p>
The PMSS MUX Control word is (X = don't care):
<table border width="75%">
<tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><th width="50%">Bits</th>
<th width="50%">Selection</th></tr>
<tr><td>0x0X</td><td>ZONE AXIAL A</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x1X</td><td>ZONE AXIAL B</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x2X</td><td>ZONE AXIAL C</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x3X</td><td>ZONE TRANSVERSE D</td></tr>
<tr><td>0xX0</td><td>CHANNEL POSITION</td></tr>
<tr><td>0xX1</td><td>CHANNEL POSITION ERROR</td></tr>
<tr><td>0xX2</td><td>CHANNEL PRESSURE</td></tr>
<tr><td>0xX3</td><td>CHANNEL PRESSURE ERROR</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<b>Shakedown: </b>
<ul>
<li>Reread sdss-controls/1751 (04 Jan 2001) to help understand the
PMSS displays.</li>
<li>Study the noise statistics on the PMSS channels using the StripTool
and/or the Archiver. You may need to refer to the TPM Channel Name document. </li>
</ul>
