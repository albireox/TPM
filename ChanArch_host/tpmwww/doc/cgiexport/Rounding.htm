  <h1>Export: Time Stamps</h1>
  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>The EPICS time stamps provide accuracy up to the nanosecond level and the
  ChannelArchiver saves those stamps without loss. The clocks of multiple I/O controllers
  can be synchronized to a high degree, so time stamps remain comparable even if the
  channels originate from different machines. <br>
  A problem arises when you compare different channels. The time stamps might differ
  slightly because a single CPU cannot scan several channels exactly at once. In addition,
  scan tasks on different machines are not synchronized, you might also want to compare
  channels that were scanned at different rates or were archived on change ('monitored'). <br>
  The net result is that for a given exact point in time the archiver will seldom find more
  than one value. When exporting in a spreadsheet format, '#N/A' is used to indicate this: </p>
  <div align="center"><center><table BORDER="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Time</th>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:28.700986000</td>
      <td>0.0718241</td>
      <td>#N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:28.701046000</td>
      <td>#N/A</td>
      <td>-0.0860064</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:37.400964000</td>
      <td>0.0543581</td>
      <td>#N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:37.510961000</td>
      <td>#N/A</td>
      <td>-0.111776</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>...</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center></div><p>In the example, the time stamps of channels A and B are obviously
  &quot;close&quot;, but since they are still different and cannot simply be put on a single
  line in a spreadsheet format.<br>
  You can still plot this data, even with interpolated lines, but calculations like
  &quot;A-B&quot; will always yield '#N/A' for the example above since either A or B is
  undefined. </p>
  <h2>Filling</h2>
  <p>When the &quot;Fill&quot; option is enabled, the previous value of a channel will be
  repeated, filling what used to end up as &quot;#N/A&quot; in the original data: </p>
  <div align="center"><center><table BORDER="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Time</th>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:28.700986000</td>
      <td>0.0718241</td>
      <td>#N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:28.701046000</td>
      <td>0.0718241</td>
      <td>-0.0860064</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>-0.0860064</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:37.510961000</td>
      <td>0.0543581</td>
      <td>-0.111776</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:39.410965000</td>
      <td>0.139948</td>
      <td>-0.111776</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>...</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center></div><p>The remaining '#N/A' entries are caused by special conditions, e.g. a
  disconnected channel. An initial undefined value appears because the filling mechanism
  starts only after the channel has a valid value.</p>
  <p>To remind you that these time stamps are not the exact ones from the archive, a comment
  is added to the header of the exported data. (A similar remark is added for the following,
  time-stamp-changing operations) </p>
  <h2>Linear Interpolation</h2>
  <p>With linear interpolation, time stamps will be chosen with a fixed period as specified
  in the &quot;Interpolate&quot; field. The values are then interpolated from the raw
  values: </p>
  <div align="center"><center><table BORDER="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Time</th>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:28.700986000</td>
      <td>0.0718241</td>
      <td>#N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:28.701046000</td>
      <td>#N/A</td>
      <td>-0.0860064</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:30.000000000</td>
      <td>0.0692162</td>
      <td>-0.089806</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:32.000000000</td>
      <td>0.065201</td>
      <td>-0.0956562</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:34.000000000</td>
      <td>0.0611858</td>
      <td>-0.101506</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3/22/2000 17:02:36.000000000</td>
      <td>0.0571706</td>
      <td>-0.107357</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center></div><p>Again some undefined values remain initially and whenever special
  conditions don't allow interpolation. </p>
  <h2>Rounding</h2>
  <p>When it's not imperative to know the exact time stamps, the export module can round
  adjacent time stamps. If the data from the example is rounded to be within 2 seconds, the
  result becomes: </p>
