  <h1>Channel Archive CGI Setup</h1>
  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <h3>Web Server</h3>
  <p>Like any other CGI tool, the CGIExport tool for the Channel Archiver is a plug-in for a
  web server.</p>
  <p>This means you have to have a running web server and you need to know how to configure
  it.</p>
  <p>In here I can only provide examples on how to configure some web servers (Apache web
  server, MS Internet Information Server/MS Personal Web Server).<br>
  If you don't understand the examples or happen to use a different server, please consider
  consulting the manual for your web server first.</p>
  <h3>Access to the archive</h3>
  <p>The CGI Tool has to have access to the data files, either directly or via NFS, SAMBA,
  ???</p>
  <h3>GNU Plot</h3>
  <p>For the plotting to work, you need GNU Plot. The path to GNU Plot is hard-coded into
  the CGIExport tool at compile time.</p>
  <h2>Example Setup</h2>
  <p>The default path names are relative but fixed and have to be similar to the Test
  directory tree underneath the CGIExport source directory. After you changed the CGIExport
  configuration in &lt;ChannelArchiver&gt;/ArchiverConfig.h, the following might no longer
  work for you:<ul>
    <li>ChannelArchiver/CGIExport/Tests/<br>
      HTML files for accessing the CGI Tool, must be exported via WWW server.<br>
      <br>
      When producing any output, CGIExport looks for files <em>cgi_body_start.txt</em> and <em>cgi_body_end.txt</em>.<br>
      This Test directory is prepared such that these files contain links to additional web
      pages about the &quot;Rounding&quot; feature etc.<br>
      <u>For now that is the &quot;Manual&quot; on how to use the CGI tool.</u></li>
    <li>..../Tests/cgi<br>
      The executable CGI tool must be copied in here as <b>CGIExport.cgi</b>.<br>
      Note the file extension, it's used in the WWW server configuration later on!<br>
      The WWW server must allow &quot;execute&quot; access to this directory.<br>
      (For Win32, the files Com.dll, db.dll and ca.dll from your EPICS/base/bin/WIN32 also have
      to be copied in here.)</li>
    <li>..../Tests/cgi/tmp<br>
      In here, the CGI tool creates temporary files, so you must create this directory</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Make sure that the WWW server as well as CGI programs launched by it (usually running
  as &quot;nobody&quot;) have access to those parts of the file system, especially check <em>write
  access</em> to ...../cgi/tmp !</p>
  <p>To test the CGI tool, make the Test directory accessible by your WWW server and make
  sure that the cgi subdirectory is executable (see below for MS and Apache specifics).</p>
  <p>There are simple Perl scripts cgi/Hi.pl and cgi/env.pl to debug your WWW setup. <br>
  You don't need perl to use the CGIExport tool in the end.<br>
  The scripts are meant to test your web server setup because many CGI extensions are
  written in Perl and therefore every web administrator should be able to help you with
  this:</p>
  <p>If installed and configured correctly, you can access <a
  href="http://%3cyour%20host%3e/archive/cgi/Hi.pl">&quot;http://&lt;your
  host&gt;/archive/cgi/Hi.pl&quot;</a> to verify that<ul>
    <li>Your web server is running at all</li>
    <li>You managed to configure it correctly in order to execute the perl-CGI scripts</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The next step is to test if you can execute the CGIExport tool:</p>
  <p>Try &quot;<a href="http://%3cyour%20host%3e/archive/cgi/Hi.pl">http://&lt;your
  host&gt;/archive/cgi/CGIExport.cgi&quot;</a>.<br>
  You should see some HTML page, no error message.</p>
  <p>For examples on how to call the CGIExport tool to actually access your archived data,
  look at the example start page.<br>
  When your WWW server setup was successful, you should be able to point your web browser to
  http://localhost/archive/Default.htm and see that initial test page.</p>
  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
  <p>Ideas on what to test:<ul>
    <li>Web Server: Can you access the web pages, e.g. the &quot;Default.htm&quot; file?</font><font
      color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS, Arial, Helvetica"></li>
    <li>Web Server: Can you access the CGI directory, i.e. read it and are the files executed as
      programs?</font><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS, Arial, Helvetica"></li>
    <li>If the perl scripts respond OK but CGIExport.cgi doesn't: Can you execute it as
      &quot;nobody&quot;? Are shared libraries missing which happen to be in your path as
      USER=&lt;you&gt; but not when you are USER=&lt;the web server=nobody&gt;?</font><font
      color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS, Arial, Helvetica"></li>
    <li>Can the cgi tool (or the pseudo-user that runs it) access the data files?</font><font
      color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS, Arial, Helvetica"></li>
    <li>Can the cgi tool create the temporary files needed for the plots?</font><font
      color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS, Arial, Helvetica"></li>
    <li>Can ... launch GNU Plot?</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Microsoft Personal Web Server</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Export the Test directory as e.g. &quot;/archive&quot;,</li>
    <li>Export Test/cgi directory as &quot;/archive/cgi&quot; and make it executable</li>
    <li>Modify registry to allow perl scripts (useful for debugging, not essential for CGI
      tool): <pre>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3Svc\Parameters\Script Map]
c:\sys\perl\bin\perl.exe %s %s;</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Apache Web Server</h2>
  <p>Add to end of /etc/httpd/httpd.conf : </p>
  <pre>  #Added for CGIExport Test:
  #
  #Uncomment these (usually found earlier in this file)
  #if you want perl support:
  #LoadModule perl_module modules/libperl.so
  #AddModule mod_perl.c
  #
  #Note that without special settings,
  #apache does not follow symb. links,
  #so these names have to be 'real':
  Alias /archive &quot;/home/Kay/Epics/extensions/src/ChannelArchiver/CGIExport/Tests&quot;
  &lt;Directory /home/Kay/Epics/extensions/src/ChannelArchiver/CGIExport/Tests&gt;
  Order Allow,Deny
  Allow from All
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
  # Make /archive/cgi executable, allow Perl:
  # (this requires the above settings to activate mod_perl)
  AddHandler perl-script .pl
  AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

  &lt;Directory /home/Kay/Epics/extensions/src/ChannelArchiver/CGIExport/Tests/cgi&gt;
  PerlHandler Apache::Registry
  PerlSendHeader On
  Options +ExecCGI
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
