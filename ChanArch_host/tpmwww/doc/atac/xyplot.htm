  <b>Syntax:</b> wish XYPlot.tk archive xChannelName yChannelName [ time ]<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>time as
  &quot;YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss&quot; in 24h format</em></p>
  <p><strong>Function:</strong></p>
  <p>Plot two array channels as an X/Y plot.</p>
  <p>Allows to move to the previous/next X/Y pair.</p>
  <p><strong>Example Snapshot:</strong></p>
  <p><img src="xyplot1.gif" width="516" height="597" alt="xyplot1.gif (23887 bytes)"></p>
  <p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
  <p>The two array channels must have the same length.</p>
  <p>An IOC can seldom provide both the X and Y value at exactly the same time, unless
  specialized code is used to attach the same time stamp to both values before serving them
  via ChannelAccess.<br>
  Therefore this plot tool tries to find an X/Y pair whose time stamps are as close as
  possible to each other. The time stamps found as well as the difference in seconds
  (&quot;gap&quot;) are displayed.</p>
  <p>The tool makes no attempt to determine if the X and Y value actually builds a
  &quot;pair&quot;, instead the user has to look at the gap value and decide if the values
  found are together &quot;close enough&quot; in time to be considered a valid X-Y pair.</p>
