  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>Common requests to the archive are: <ul>
    <li>&quot;How often was value <i>x</i> above 10 in the last week?&quot; </li>
    <li>&quot;Show me <i>x</i> times <i>y</i> whenever <i>z</i> is on!&quot; </li>
    <li>... </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Another possible application is the interactive or automated generation of dayly
  reports.<br>
  Images of those plots can then be put on Web pages etc.:</p>

  <p>Requests like these will never be easy to answer with a standard GUI tool, instead they
  require some sort of programming or query <i>language</i>. </p>
  <h2><a name="Why TCL?">Why TCL?</a></h2>
  <p>Short answer: Because it was of immediate use at LANL.</p>
  <p>More reasons: Tool languages like Perl or TCL lack the computing power of SDDS, MatLab,
  ....,<br>
  but most programmers know them and with such a scripting language at hand you can generate
  other formats as needed.</p>
  <p>TCL was one of the first embeddable scripting langages, it now runs (together with tk
  for a GUI) on Unix and Win32. So do Perl and Python. Now also with a GUI, in fact the very
  same tk, though that's faily new and less well known and supported. While I really like
  Perl, it's emphasis is still on text processing, TCL is faster for numerics.</p>
  <p>A common problem with tcl was that extensions had to be compiled in, some were mutually
  exclusive or you could not easily use one extension without getting many others as well.
  Since version 8.0 dynamic loading is supported.</p>
  <p>So TCL was chosen. Perl, Python, ... might still follow, but not at a high priority </p>
  <h2><a name="Usage">Usage</a></h2>
  <p>After staring tcl (or wish, tcldp, bltwish, ...), load the atac extension: <ul>
    <pre>source atacTools.tcl</pre>
  </ul>
