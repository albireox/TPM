<h3>
Alarm Requirements</h3>
JEG: sdss-controls/333: The criteria for temperatures will have to be honed
as we learn what
<br>is important and what not, but some basic things are:
<p>a. Alarm if the average of the front-face mirror sensors differ from
the average of the back-face sensors by more than Mir_FB, where Mir_FB
is something like 0.2C, separately for each mirror and each (90 degree
?) sector. The sectors are up-down-left-right, and should perhaps be the
upper HALF , the lower HALF, the right HALF, and the left HALF.
<p>b. Alarm if any two sensors on a given mirror are different by more
than Mir_Del, where Mir_Del is about 2C.
<p>c. Alarm if any linear gradient Gx = (Sum(Tfb*x)/Sum(x^2))*D, Gy = (Sum(Tfb*y)/Sum(y^2))*D,
Gt = sqrt( Gx^2 + Gy^2), where D is the mirror diameter and Tfb is the
average of the front and back face sensors at a given location) is greater
than Mir_Grad, where Mir_grad is about 1C.
<p>d. Alarm if the radial gradient, defined as the mean of the peripheral
sensors minus the mean of the central sensors, is greater than Mir_Rgrad,
where Mir_Rgrad is about 1C.
<p>e. Alarm if the mean of the primary sensors differs from the mean of
the PSS sensors by more than Mir_denv, where Mir_denv is about 2C
<p>f. Alarm if the mean of the primary sensors differs from the mean of
the near-telescope air sensors by more than Tel_air, where Tel_air is about
2C
<p>g. Alarm if the mean of the floor sensors differs from the mean of the
near-telescope air sensors by more than Floor_air, where floor_air is about
2C.
<p>h. Alarm if the return coolant temperature is different from the mean
of the near-telescope air sensors by more than Inst_air, where Inst_air
is about 3C (it is running at about 10C now)
<p>i. Alarm if the mean of the lower enclosure air sensors differs from
the mean of the near-telescope air sensors by more than Lower_air, where
Lower_air is about 3C (it runs now at about 8C).
<h3>
Temperature Sensor Quantities</h3>
<p>
A word on notation: The sensors that make up each category are
listed by module, block, and channel numbers as M-B-{C,..C}. Channel
numbers prefixed by 'S' indicate sensors that are split across
zone boundaries and are weighted by 0.5 when contributing to the
mean.
<p> 
Positions are given in terms of angles measured clockwise from the
top of the temperature sensor maps. For example, the Upper half 
includes sensors between the angles of 270 and 90 degrees in the
clockwise direction.
<p>
Each list of sensors is followed by the record type and name of 
the associated TPM EPICS database record. For example, the mean
of the M1 Front Upper sensors is a calc (calculation block) record
named tpm_TM_M1FrontUpperAvg.
