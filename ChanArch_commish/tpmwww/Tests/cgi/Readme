To make the CGIExport test work,
you have to put the executable CGIExport or CGIExport.exe
in here and rename it to CGIExport.cgi.
For Win32, you also have the required DLLs available,
i.e. either here or in the %PATH%
(Required: ca.dll, com.dll, db.dll, maybe more)

For GNUPlot to work, you need
1) gnuplot
2) a 'tmp' directory in here
