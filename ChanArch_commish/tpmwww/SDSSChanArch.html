<center><h1>SDSS Specific Channel Archiver Information</h1></center>
<blockquote>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The original TPM logging system was replaced by the Experimental Physics and Industrial
Control System (EPICS) channel archiver during the summer shutdown of 2000. 
This document describes the SDSS specific installation and operation of archive
engine and of the archive data clients.
<p>
<h2>Archive Engine</h2>
Unlike the TPM logger which ran on the TPM vxWorks CPU, the EPICS channel archiver
is resident on a workstation, in our case sdsshost. The archiver utilizes the channel
access communications protocol to acquire control system data across the local network.
Channel access is the fundamental TCP/IP protocol used in the EPICS toolkit and it is
used by the real-time displays.

<h3>Archive Engine Startup</h3>
In order to manually start the archive engine an ASCII configuration file must be
created. 
See the LANL documentation on the configuration
<a href="http://lansce.lanl.gov/lansce8/epics/PC/ArchiverLibrary/doc/engine/usage.htm">
file syntax</a>.
<p>
The first step to working with the archiver, as with any TPM subsystem, is to 
properly set up your user environment on sdsshost. This is accomplished by typing: <br>
% setup tpm<br>
at the UNIX command prompt.<p>

The archiver can then be started with a number of command line options:<br>
<menu>
<li>% ArchiveEngine [Options] config-file &<br>
OR<br>
<li>% ArchiveEngine [Options] config-file directory-file &<br>
</menu>
<br>
Options:<br><menu>
<li>-port port-number
<ul>WWW server's TCP port (default 4812)</ul>
<li>-description text-string
<ul>description for HTTP display</ul>
<li>-log file-name
<ul>write logfile</ul>
</menu>
<br> 
Default directory-file: 'freq_directory'<p>
