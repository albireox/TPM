<h3>Shakedown Requests</h3>

<h4>LN2 Pressure readings</h4>
<b>PR 4381:</b>
The observers should verify the LN2 pressure readings displayed on the main
TPM display. They should verify that the TPM channels tpm_LN2press_spectro
and tpm_LN2press_imager are being archived. 

<h4>PLC files B3 and B10</h4>
<b>PR 4865:</b> The current release of data_collection.h now properly exports all of the
PLC B3 word, thus extending the number of interlock 16-bit words 
reported by the TPM from 182 to 190.  This work was required by the
"rebuilding of the world". 

<p>
Changes visible to the observers are:
<li>The B3 display under the TPM Interlocks menu now contains 20 shortwords.<br>
<b>Action:</b> Examine TPM displays for B3 and B10, crosscheck with MCP 
equivalent (if exists).
<li>The TPM archiver now includes tpm_ABB3_12 through tpm_ABB3_19.<br>
<b>Action:</b> Obtain tpm_ABB3_12 through tpm_ABB3_19 values from the TPM
archives using LibIO client of choice (probably CGI-BIN interface).
<li>The TPM abdump utility now exports 20 words under B3.<br>
<b>Action:</b> Run abdump utility and verify that the IOP start_interlocks display
make sense using the generated Yanny parameter file.

<h4>M2 Galil Readings</h4>
During an engineering phone-con near the start of the summer shutdown
it was agree that the serial port speed between the TPM#2 and the M2 Galil
be increased from 19200 baud to 38400. Russell Owen and Peregrine McGehee
performed a successful test.
<p>
<b>Action:</b> The observers should examine the TPM Galils display and verify
the numbers.

<h4>Analog PLC Values</h4>
<b>PR 4659:</b>
Jon Brinkmann created the following TPM process variables, testing them
on the IPM EPICS test-bed. These have now been incorporated into the
TPM#1 system, the TPM displays (under Details/PLC Analogs), and
the archiver.
<li>tpm_AzWindErr - Windscreen Azimuth Servo Error (volts)
<li>tpm_AltWindErr - Windscreen Altitude Servo Error (volts)
<li>tpm_LiftForce - Instrument Lift Force (lbs)
<li>tpm_LiftPos - Instrument Lift Position (inches)
<li>tpm_CW1Pos - Counterweight #1 Position (inches)
<li>tpm_CW2Pos - Counterweight #2 Position (inches)
<li>tpm_CW3Pos - Counterweight #3 Position (inches)
<li>tpm_CW4Pos - Counterweight #4 Postion (inches)
<p>
<b>Action:</b> The observers should check the TPM displays and the archiver
for these channels and verify the reported values.

<h4>Tracking Alarms</h4>
<b>PR 4973 and PR 4494:</b>
The TPM logic for generation of tracking alarms has been substantially modified
(see Release Notes). 
<p>
<b>Action:</b>
Peregrine will conduct an analysis using the archiver
during the shakedown week once the telescope is back on the sky.
<p>
<b>Action:</b>
The observers should check the time (minutes) into the current track 
that is shown in the upper left hand side of the main TPM display. This value is also
archived. The TPM process variable name is tpm_TrackTime.

<h4>Dewar Scale Communications Alarms</h4>
<b>PR 4973 and PR 4494:</b>
The bulk of the serial communications arise from the spectrograph and
imager dewar scales. Jon Brinkmann pointed out that these connections are
likely more sensitive to electrical and/or vibration noise due to two factors.
<li>Unlike the other TPM serial devices, the wiring does not immediately
go (Jon - at all?) into fiber optics.
<li>The copper section of the serial communications cable is composed of
two runs joined together. The integrity of that connection needs to checked.
<p>
<b>Action:</b> Peregrine and Jon will conduct a test on the effect of the
air conditioning system on the noise rates. Examination of the archives shows
that the highest error rate on both dewar scales occurs during the day with
a smaller maximum during operations (drive motors noise/vibration?). While
many daytime errors on the spectrograph dewar scale are because the
spectrograph dewar is often moved away from its scale to facilitate engineering
operations in the enclosures, this does not account for the daytime imager
dewar scale faults.
<p>
The proposed test is to wait for the air conditioning system to come on
and then to turn it off for one hour between noon and 1pm. The dewar
scale communications error rates will be compared between these
two periods. 
<p>
<b>Action:</b> Peregrine will examine the archiver logs generated during the
shakedown to check for correlation of communications error rate with
drive amplifier status and/or motion.
<p>
<b>Action:</b> A proposal to upgrade the cabling between the TPM and
dewar scales should be discussed at the 20 Sept 2003 Engineering 
phone-con.

<h4>New Temperature Sensor Failure Mode</h4>
<b>PR 4388, PR 4917, PR 4973 and PR 4494:</b>
See Release Notes for details.
<p>
<b>Action:</b> This needs to discussed at the 20 September 2003 Engineering
phone-con. 

<h4>LVDT Readings</h4>
<b>PR 4429:</b>
Jon Brinkmann reports that the LVDT readings obtained from the Allen-Bradley
system are non-sensical.
<p>
<b>Action:</b> This needs to discussed at the 20 September 2003 Engineering
phone-con.



<h3>Release Notes</h3>

<h4>Temperature Alarms</h4>
We presently know of four possible states that a individual temperature sensor
can be in:
<br>
<li>Normal.
<li>Disconnected. In this case the reported temperature is less than
-50 degC and all other sensors in the row are affected. 
<li>Affected by a disconnected sensor in the row. The TPM channels
that constitute a single row have the identical module numbers and record
field names (VALA-VALH), but different block numbers. 
Thus, if tpm_M0B2Chans.VALD were disconnected
then tpm_M0B0Chans.VALD through tpm_M0B7Chans.VALD would all
have spurious readings.
<li>Temporarily replaced by a resister. In this case the other sensors
in the row are unaffected although this sensor would be reporting an
arbitrary value (see below).
<p>
The current misbehaving sensors are (see sdss-apodaylog/1118) are:
<li>M0B0S4  on M1, previously seen and replaced with a resistor. Reading
-131.99 degC.
<li>M0B0S6  on M1, previously seen and replaced with a resistor. Reading
84.66 degC. <b>This would not be caught by the present TPM Watcher 
alarms</b>
<li>M0B0S7  on M1, new... reads -1.40 degC and is not affecting other readings
<li>M0B5S4  on M1 internal baffle, new... reads -0.84 degC and is not
affecting other readings.  We checked the wiring and
found no problems.  We're unsure where the problem lies.
 <p>
The three sensors on M1 are at "2 o'clock" as viewed from the rear of the
mirror.  The sensor on the internal baffle is at "4 o'clock".    

<h4>Tracking Alarms</h4>
Investigation of the TPM tracking alarms, which are based on the reported
MEI servo errors, resulted in redefinition of the TPM's appraisal of the
operational state of the telescope and a reformulation of the trracking
alarm condition.

<h5>Telescope mode</h5>

Analysis of the TPM's determination of the telescope operational mode
(tpm_telescope_mode = 1 if operational, 0 if not) resulted in a change to
the test against the Altitude drive Amp #1 status.
<p>
The specific change in tpm_telescope_mode.CALC is from
<pre>C||((A&16)&&(B#4095))</pre>
to
<pre>C||((A&16)&&(B=4092))</pre>
where the test against B (tpm_AL1_Ampstat) now correctly checks for
enabled state.
This record was moved from the database file util2.db used by TPM#2 to
util.db used by TPM#1.

<p>
Likewise for tpm_aztrackchk and tpm_rottrackchk.

<h4>Serial communications.</h4>

We believe there may be a correlation between the dewar scale comm errors and
noise sources. Specifically: air conditioner and drive motors.
<p>
The required test is to observe the error rate when the AC is on during the
day and then to turn it off of a period of one hour.
