<h3>Serial communications error rate</h3>
<p>
<b>PR 4973/4494:</b>
TPM Alarms
<p>    
<b>Item:</b>
Changes to serial communications error handling (fixed bug).
<p>
<b>To test:</b>
Examine rate of serial communications alarms reported by TPM/watcher.

Working file: rtApp/src/tpmSerial.c

<h3>Handling of faulty temperature sensors</h3>
<p>
<b>PR 4973/4494:</b>
TPM Alarms
<p>
<b>Item:</b>
Improved temperature sensor fault handling. New .db file.
<p>
<b>To test:</b> No action required.<br>
<p>
Working file: iocBoot/ioctpm2/st.cmd

<p>
<b>Item:</b>
Improved temperature sensor fault handling.
<p>
<b>To test:</b>
The TPM now only alarms on sensor values less than -200 degC
which indicate a broken sensor. Values less than -50 degC
are interpreted as from sensors that are patched by a resistor.
The TPM no longer indicates sensors whose readings are less
than -50 degC in the computation of thermal gradients and 
differences used in computing alarms.
<p>
Please check the TPM temperature displays for reasonable values.

<b>Item:</b>
Updated temperature sensor WWW pages to include status and
to populate both CURRENT and TEST areas.
<p>
<b>To test:</b>
Examine TPM WWW pages under tpmTest. The pages listed under
<b>Current temperature sensor data (updated every 15 minutes:</b> 
now include a STATUS column indicating BAD, Patched, or good
(nothing) based on value.  Updated values are now seen under
both the tpm (points to current) and the tpmTest (points
to test) WWW pages.

<h4>PLC analog values</h4>
<p>
<b>PR 4659:</b> 
Analog values
<p>
<b>Item:</b>
Jon Brinkmann writes:
Attached is my revision of the file plc_analog.db, reflected the
revised channel assignments and names from John Anderson in v17 of the
PLC code.  Since we access the channels by their addresses rather than
their names, the change in the EPICS database is independent of cutting
a new MCP and IOP with the new data_collection.h.
<p>
Now that we have the correct channels for the windbaffle servo loop errors,
think we have the scaling incorrect.  The 1746-NI4 Allen-Bradley module
outputs 16 bit two's complement values, i.e., the output ranges from
-32,768 to 32,768.  It appears that the TPM is handling the record
as 16 bit unsigned.  Is that correct?  If so, what would be the best
way to get the records, tpm_AzWindErr and tpm_AltWindErr, converted
to 16 bit two's complement?  The calc that I have used is not correct.
<p>
<b>To test:</b>
View PLC analog values on TPM display. Verify reasonableness
of values, including the windbaffle servo errors

<h4>MIG1 Scaling: per 10 Sept 03 Engineering phone-con</h4>
<p>
<b>Item:</b>
Scaled MIG1_EL and MIG1_FL from inches to mm, changed
all EGU (engineering units) to "mm".
<p>
<b>To test:</b>
Read MIG1 values.
<p>
Working file: rtApp/Db/mig.db

<h4>Wrong TPM channel on sensor module display</h4>
<p>
<b>Item:</b>
Corrected PV associated with sensor 01 value.
<p>
<b>To test:</b>
Verify (via middle mouse click) TPM channel name 
associated sensor #01 text display on temperature
sensor module display.
