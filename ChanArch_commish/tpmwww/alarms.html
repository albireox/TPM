<center><h1>Telescope Performance Monitor Alarm Management</h1>
Peregrine M. McGehee - 31 July 2002
</center>

<blockquote>
<h3>Action Items</h3>
Feedback is required from the following individuals as part
of the TPM Alarm system design process:
<ul>
<li>John Anderson - motor current limits
<li>Jim Gunn/Russell Owen - M1 oscillation amplitude as seen by the MIGs.
<li>Jim Gunn/Russell Owen - conditions for excess M2 tilt as seen by the MIGs.
<li>Jim Gunn - the signatures for thermal management problems on M1, M2, and the truss. 
</ul>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
The TPM is responsible for the monitoring and archiving of engineering 
parameters specific to the mount and other telescope subsystems. To ensure 
the quality of the science data during the course of a run, it is required 
that the TPM inform the users in real-time that non-optimal conditions exist
in the performance of the telescope.
<p>
Specific requirements are:
<ul>
R1. The state of the TPM alarms shall be visible to the observers and 
engineering staff in the SDSS control room, at the telescope, and at 
remote locations.<p>
R2. TPM alarm history shall be stored in a time-stamped log to facilitate
comparison with other archived engineering data. <p>
R3. The parameters that define the generation of alarms shall have 
sensible values upon startup but shall be able to be modified without
reboot of the TPM upon a consensus of the operations staff and project 
management. <p>
R4. The TPM shall send a signal to the Watcher indicating that a 
TPM alarm has occurred and that the operators should refer to the 
TPM for specifics.
</ul>
<p>
Additional goals are:
<ul>
G1. The TPM shall generate an auditory signal to alert operations staff.
<p>
G2. The visual and auditory alarms shall require operator acknowledgement.
</ul>
<p>
The performance areas of concern presently identified by the project are:
<ul>
A1. Tracking performance. For each the three axes of the telescope, 
an alarm will
be generated under conditions of tracking when the reported servo error exceeds
a threshold. Tracking is presently defined as the absolute value of the
velocity component of the MCP PVT triplet being less than a set value, 
presently three times the sidereal rate of 15 arcsec/sec. For the altitude
and azimuth axes this translates to 3200 counts/sec. The equivalent rate
for the rotator is 2100 counts/sec. The threshold for the MEI reported servo 
error is 10 counts.
<p>
A2. High motor current. For each of the five motor amplifiers, two 
possible alarms shall be generated. A warning alarm shall be generated
when the reported motor current exceeds 50% of the maximum value. A critical
alarm shall be generated when the reported motor current exceeds
90% of the maximum value. The maximum reported current is TBD (John Anderson).
<p>
A3. M1 oscillation. When the primary mirror oscillates it does
so at a rate of approximately 1Hz. The TPM shall generate 
an alarm if the time rate of change in M1 MIG positions exceeds a set value. 
This threshold is TBD (Russell Owen and Jim Gunn).
<p>
A4. M2 tilt. Large differences between the M2 MIG readings may indicate
an out of range tilt. The TPM shall generate 
an alarm if the differences between the M2 MIG positions exceeds a set value. 
This threshold is TBD (Russell Owen and Jim Gunn).
<p>
A5. Thermal management. The TPM shall generate an alarm if the temperature 
differential across the M1 support, the M2 support, or the truss exceeds 
a limit. An alarm shall also be generated if the time rate of change of 
the reported temperatures exceeds a limit. The details are pending an 
analysis (Jim Gunn).
<p>
A6. MS.ON failure. The TPM shall generate an alarm when MS.ON
encounters an error that is too large to correct.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Overview of TPM architecture</h3>

The TPM is based on the 
<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/index.php">
Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System 
(EPICS)</a>
toolkit which is in widespread use across the international 
telescope and accelerator communities including at the Gemini and Keck 
Observatories. EPICS provides an infrastructure for the creation of 
distributed real-time control systems that is robust, flexible, and 
extensible.  The control system model implemented by EPICS is that of
a client-server architecture operating on global namespace of process 
variables. The operations supported by the communications protocol 
(channel access) include get and put actions, notification of changes 
in value or alarm status via monitors, connection management, and a
non-centralized discovery mechanism to connect to process variable servers.
<p>
Each process variable has an associated alarm status, indicating the nature
of the alarm, and an alarm severity. The alarm severity can take on one of 
the following four values listed here in order of increasing severity: 
NONE, MINOR, MAJOR, and INVALID (generally a communications error).
<p>
All of the operator applications that comprise the TPM, the displays, 
stripcharts, and archiver, are clients of the channel access communications 
protocol.
<p>
In the case of the TPM, the process variables are tied to a real-time 
VxWorks-based database where the name of each process variable reflects 
the name and the field (or attribute) of each record. 
<p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

The proposed implementation of the TPM alarm system makes use of the 
existing capabilities of the EPICS toolkit as installed at Apache Point. 
Specifcally, the requirements are met using the operator displays and the 
TPM archiver. The alarm management goals are met by simple configuration of 
the standard EPICS alarm handler tool.
<p>
<b>Generation of Alarms</b>
<p>
The TPM will internally generate alarms using constructs built
using
<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/asd/controls/epics/EpicsDocumentation/AppDevManuals/RecordRef/Recordref-1.html">records</a> within the EPICS
database. 
Specific use will be
made of the ability to configure the alarm generation of the 
<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/asd/controls/epics/EpicsDocumentation/AppDevManuals/RecordRef/Recordref-8.html#HEADING8-0">Analog Input record.</a>
<p>

</center>
<p>
Required calculations will be performed in the EPICS database using
Calculation, and if need be, Subroutine (or GenSub) records.
<p>
Signal processing can be performed by using a Compression record
with the ALG (algorithm) set to "N to 1 Average" to compute the mean
value. A median filter can be created using a Subroutine record in
a manner similar to that used on the temperature sensor data.
<p>

<b>Configuration and Display of Alarms</b>
<p>
The Display Manager 
(<a href="http://lansce.lanl.gov:80/lansce8/Epics/OPI/opintro-1.html">DM</a>) 
application implements the TPM real-time displays 
that are now a familiar part of the SDSS controls environment. DM supports 
the concept of color rules, in which the appearance of a graphical widget 
can change based on a process variable value or alarm state. The DM displays 
also have read and write access to the process variables that define each 
alarm. We suggest that a DM interface into the TPM alarms fulfulls
requirements R1 and R3. 
<p>
<b>Archival of Alarms</b>
<p>
The existing channel archiver maintains a log of the value, timestamp,
and alarm status and severity for each process variable that it
archives. The alarm status and severity can be obtained via the
<a href="Tests/cgi/dir.cgi">
CGI-BIN interface</a>
by selecting the Status option and issuing a GET command. 
<p>
Additional process variables can be created in the database
that summarize the alarms for groups of channels, such as the tracking status
for all three axes. 
<p>
This satisfies requirement 
R2 and maintains a single point of access for all engineering data.
<p>
<b>Watcher Notification</b>
<p>
Communication between the TPM and the Watcher requires that either
the Watcher become aware of the channel access protocol, or that
the TPM supports the "packeteer" UDP based system. While channel
access is designed specifically for distributed control systems,
it is the latter option that will most likely be implemented for
compatibility with historical systems at the SDSS.
<p>
The TPM and the Watcher will share a minimal interface in which the
only signal sent from the TPM informs the Watcher that a TPM alarm
has occurred. No communciations will be sent from the Watcher to the 
TPM. This satisfies requirement R4.
<p>
<b>Advanced Alarm Management</b>
<p>
In order to support the additional goals, we will need to configure the 
EPICS 
<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/extensions/alh/index.php">
Alarm Handler application (ALH)</a>. 
ALH is another channel access client 
that supports definition of a hierarchical alarm tree via a 
simple ASCII file. ALH functions include:
<ul>
<li>Pop-up window for new alarms
<li>Audible signal
<li>Hierarchical display of system alarms
<li>Options to require operator acknowledgement (alarms can be masked to
bypass this feature)
<li>Optional help dialogs and operator initiated recovery procedures
<li>Maintenance of alarm history logs
</ul>
<p>
ALH was built on sdsshost as part of the original EPICS installation.
